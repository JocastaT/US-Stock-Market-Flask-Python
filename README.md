# US Stock Market 
As investment are becoming another source of income for most retirement plans, the process of investing through website should be eased where our group has designed our website with a fresh minimal look so that you can efficiently and decide better on the type of stocks to purchase. To effectively make investing simpler for you, the website is expected to provide enough statistics for you to decide what stocks to purchase. The website I have created is based on U.S Equities that acts as a stock screener aims to allow you to efficiently sort through thousands of individual securities to find those that fit their own methodologies, save time, removing behavioral biases from the stock selection process, and finding new investment opportunities.
